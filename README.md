# Bus Tracker Application ( Work in Progress )

Welcome to my Bus Tracker Application! This project is designed to know the real-time location of buses in Buenos Aires and their distance to you. With a simple interface and an interactive map, you can search for any bus line from Buenos Aires and see its route and current position. I created this as a personal project to practice and make use of the React framework.

## Main Features

- *Bus Line Search*: Enter the bus line number you want to track and get instant information about its current status.
- *Interactive Map*: View the route and current positions of buses on a dynamic map.
- *Real-Time Updates*: Leverages the Buenos Aires City transportation API to provide real-time data on bus locations.
- *Distance Calculation*: Displays the approximate distance from your location to the bus in meters and time, based on the average speed of buses in Argentina.

## Technologies Used

- *React*: For building the user interface.
- *Leaflet*: For displaying interactive maps.
- *Buenos Aires Transportation API*: For obtaining real-time bus data.
